1. The Yelp and VSCode guidelines share very similar guidelines. 
First, they encourage collaboration amongst a team but emphasize doing it in a respectful and meaningful manner. In addition, 
they emphasize the importance of short, concise reviews including feedback and push comments. They also have different recommendations
and concentrate on different aspects of code review. For example, Yelp provdies guidelines for how to review code, certain things to look for,
and a checklist to ensure that the code is not only up to date, but accurate and well tested. The VSCode guidelines focus more on how to communicate
with your group members. They emphasize the importance of being respectful in your code review and how to take constructive criticism.

concise comments on what exactly is being reviewed and 
examples on how to fix certain aspects. This is a good
code review because there is no ambiguity and
the programmer knows exactly what needs to be fixed
withouth feeling attacked or talked down to.
